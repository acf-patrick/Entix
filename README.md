Program core using an entity-component system and SDL2 for rendering.

---
🏗️ Get started quickly using this [template](https://github.com/acf-patrick/entix-template) project

### Why should you use the template project ?
- It already has a build system set up for you :
    - Seamlessly integrate with the library build system
    - Enables asset embedding on release
- CMake is the most used build system for C/C++ project anyway
- You don't want to rewrite CMake script, do you ? 
- Like every template, provides minimal code that can be tweaked and run.
